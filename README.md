# Path Discovery in a 3-Agent Transportation World Using Reinforcement Learning 


## Overview


## Folder Structure

Brief explanation of the folder structure and the purpose of each file:
- `Agent.py`: Contains the Agent class responsible for defining the behavior of the agent.
- `Environment.py`: Defines the Environment class responsible for simulating the environment.
- `Experiments.py`: Contains the Experiments class responsible for running experiments.
- `Results.py`: Contains the ResultPrinter class responsible for printing experiment results.
- `main.py`: Entry point of the program.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all files (`Agent.py`, `Environment.py`, `Experiments.py`, `Results.py`, `main.py`) are in the same directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
4. Run the `main.py` file by executing the following command: python main.py
5. When prompted, enter a seed value for random number generation. If no seed is provided, a random value will be generated.


## Replicating Experiments with Specified Seed

To replicate experiments with a specified seed, follow these steps:
1. Run the `main.py` file as described above.
2. When prompted, enter a specific seed value. Make a note of this seed value.
3. The experiments conducted in the system will use this seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility.

## Note

- All experiments conducted in the system will use the specified seed value for random number generation. Replicating experiments with the same seed will yield consistent results.
- Experiment results, including rewards, success rates, and Q-tables, will be displayed in the terminal output.
